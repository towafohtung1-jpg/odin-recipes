 Introduction:  
The idea of this project is to build a simple website as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum. Odin Recipes is designed to help me practice and solidify my understanding of basic HTML.

Reflection:  
By completing this project, I’ve demonstrated the ability to:
- Use semantic HTML elements  
- Create and link multiple HTML pages  
- Structure content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images  

In the future, I’ll return to this site to style it with CSS and make it more dynamic.
